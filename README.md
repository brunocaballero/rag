# Workshop: Retrieval-Augmented Generation 101

Join us for a hands-on introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) where we will build a simple RAG system from scratch. This workshop will cover essential concepts like word embeddings and guide participants through implementing RAG using Langchain in Java, leveraging OpenAI models for simplicity.

Participants will need a laptop with a Java IDE and a network connection to fully engage in this interactive session. Whether you're new to RAG or looking to deepen your understanding, this workshop offers a practical, step-by-step approach to mastering the basics.
